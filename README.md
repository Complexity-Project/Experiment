# Visual Complexity Perception Experiment

## Overview
This experiment explores how participants perceive **visual complexity** in images. Built using [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/), the experiment allows participants to compare image pairs and select which one appears more visually complex. The results aim to enhance our understanding of human perception and its applications in fields like computer vision and design.
